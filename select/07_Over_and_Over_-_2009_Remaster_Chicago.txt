Fireworks, fireflies
On the roof watching
Summer night skies

All the boys, all the girls
All the time making love
With our eyes

Life just went on for us
Day after day
We could fly, oh
Cocky, so confident
There was no way we could die

Over, over and over again
Life is a circle
But it's over and over again
Over, over, hey

Little words, little games
The dramas we played
Left behind

Little friends, little names
Puppy lovers we had
Love was blind

Life just went on for us
Dsy after day
Screaming by, oh
Fast as a shooting star
Cruising the midnight sky

Over, over and over again
Life is a circle
But it's over and over again
Over, over, hey

It goes on forever
It goes on forever

Over, over and over again
Life is a circle
But it's over and over again
It just goes on and on

Over, over and over again
Life is a circle
But it's over and over again
