Well it's plain, to see,
What you're doing to me.
You can have, anything,
If you think that that's the way it should be.
When you move up close to me,
And call out my name,
I get a feeling deep inside,
That's driving me insane.
When you're near, or far,
I see you deep in need.
'Cause I know, it's you,
That brings the best out in me.

Chorus:
Say it over and over, I gotta hear it again.
Say it over and over, you know I gotta hear it again.
Say it over and over, yeah I gotta hear it again.
HIT IT!

Solo

Chorus:
Say it over and over, I gotta hear it again.
Say it over and over, you know I gotta hear it again.

Oooooh yeah...
Let me hear you say it, over and over again.
I said over and over, I gotta hear it again.
Say it over and over, you know I gotta hear it again.
Say it over and over, I gotta hear it again.
Say it over and over, yeah I gotta hear it again.
